# FusionX_KDSH_2026
Analyzing long-form narratives (100k+ words) for the Kharagpur Data Science Hackathon 2026. This project uses the Pathway framework to evaluate the global consistency and causal reasoning of hypothetical character backstories. We focus on evidence aggregation and constraint tracking over long contexts.
